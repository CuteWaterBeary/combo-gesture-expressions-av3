# ComboGestureExpressions (CGE) for Avatar Dynamics

### [> Download latest version...](https://github.com/hai-vr/combo-gesture-expressions-av3/releases)

*ComboGestureExpressions* is an Unity Editor tool that lets you attach face expressions to hand gestures and take as much advantage of *Avatars 3.0* features, including *Avatar Dynamics* and *OSC*.

It is bundled with *Visual Expressions Editor*, an animation editor that lets you create face expressions with the help of previews.

A common issue with classic avatars are face expressions that conflict when both hands are combined.
For instance, if a face expression closes the eyes on the left hand, but lowers the eyelids on the other hand, the face will look wrong. 

*ComboGestureExpressions* takes advantage of Avatars 3.0 animators to fix this using predictable combo animations, but also introduces new features that will expand the expressions of your avatar:

- Using the expressions menu, attach multiple expressions on a single gesture by switching between entire sets of face expressions representing different moods.
- Eyes will no longer blink whenever the avatar has a face expression with eyes closed.
- Puppets and blend trees are integrated into the tool, with automatic correction of incorrect blending.
- PhysBones, Contacts and OSC can be used to blend in face expressions.
- ...and more tweaks.

This tool should NOT be used for:

- ‚ùå Animating hand and finger positions.
  To animate hand and finger positions, use the Avatars 3.0's Gesture layer which is made for this purpose.
