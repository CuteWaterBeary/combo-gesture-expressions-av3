## Other tweaks

- **Analog fist blinking threshold**: This is the threshold at which the eyes blinking become disabled when an non-Eyes Closed animation is blending with an Eyes Closed animation. Example: If the value is 0.95, it means the Eyes Closed animation must be at least 95% to disable eyes blinking.

## Corrections

- **Gesture Weight Correction**: This sets the Gesture Weight lerp correction for remote players.
