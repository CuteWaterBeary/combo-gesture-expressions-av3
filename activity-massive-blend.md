# "Massive Blend" Mood Set

Massive blend is an advanced mood set that allows blending between multiple mood sets.

For instance, when your *Fingerpoint* face expression is an open mouth in one mood set, and a winking face in another mood set:
if you blend at 30%, then the mouth will be 70% open, and your eye will be 30% closed.

You will be able to control the amount of blending using Avatars 3.0.

## Simple Mode

In Simple Mode, there is one parameter ranging between 0.0 and 1.0, and you can define two mood sets for these two positions.

## Two Directions Mode

In Two Directions Mode, there is one parameter ranging between -1.0 and 1.0, and you can define three mood sets for the position 0.0, 1.0, and -1.0.

You can reuse the same mood set for two different positions.

## Complex Blend Tree

In Complex Blend Tree, your parameters will depend on the type of tree that you will choose to use. You can define as many mood sets as there are slots.

For instance, if you create a 2D Freeform Blend Tree with 5 slots, then you will have two parameters and you can define exactly 5 mood sets.

You can reuse the same mood set in different slots.
