## Preview dummy

A preview dummy is a duplicate copy of your avatar that CGE will use to generate previews of your animations.

Making a duplicate copy ensures that CGE does not modify the avatar by accident.

For best results, it is recommended that you:

- Make sure *Legacy Blendshape Normals* options is check in the import settings of your avatar mesh (VRChat will force you to check this box).
- If you use glitter or any sort of animated skin, remove them by creating a new material that does not have those.
- Disable or remove particle systems.
